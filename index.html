<p>Many people assume that the most important thing to consider when purchasing <a href="https://geembi.com/collections/cultures/irish/">irish rugs</a> is color and pattern. When placing the rug in a room or under furniture, it is important to consider the size and shape of the rug. Before you start your search for the perfect rug, visualize your desired rug placement in your space.</p>

<h2>To help you pick a layout, consider the following irish rug positioning and placing options:</h2>

<p>It is up to you to decide how a rug should be placed in your room. It is important to find the right rug for you and your decorating style. Please take our rug placement guide with caution. Only you will know the perfect rug!</p>

<h3>How to Place Iris Rugs in Your Living Room</h3>

<p>Your room&#39;s shape and your furniture will dictate the size of your rug, how it is positioned within the room, and what shape it takes. If the sofa is to be placed on the rug, ensure that it extends at least 6 inches from each side.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the Rug so that all of the legs of your couch are on it</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>A large rug is required to place all the legs of the sofa on it. This option is ideal for furniture that is floating (i.e., furniture that isn&#39;t placed against a wall), or anchoring a living space in an open plan area. All furniture should be placed directly on the rug to unify them and create a defined seating area.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the rug so that the front legs of your sofa are on it.</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>Although this option can be used in many ways, it works best when one edge of the furniture group is against a wall. Consistency is key to a cohesive look. The rug should be large enough for all front legs to rest on, while the back legs can remain off the rug.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the Rug on the Coffee Table Only</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It plays with the space and tricks the brain into believing the room is bigger than it is. A small-sized rug makes a great coffee table for small spaces. Consider the dimensions of the seating area to ensure the right proportion. This will ensure that there is enough negative space.</p>

<h3>How to Place Iris Rugs in Your Dining Room</h3>

<p>The size and shape the dining table, as well as the layout of the room, will determine the appropriate area rug to fit in the room. It should be easy to decide between a rectangular or a round-shaped rug based on the size of your room and the shape of your table.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the rug so that all of the legs for the dining table and chairs are on it</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It is simple to place the legs of the table on the rug for dining rooms. The rule of thumb is that the rug should extend at least 24 inches beyond the table legs. This will ensure that dining room chairs can be pushed back by people as they get up from the table.</p>

<p>*If applicable, don&#39;t forget to include any extendable leaves. Most people will choose a rug that is durable and will look great in the dining area, even if they rarely open the table.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Rectangular Rug Positioned Under A Rectangular Dining Room Table</h4>
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Round Rug Placed under a Round Dining Room Table</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>How to Place Iris Rugs in Your Bedroom</h3>

<p>The bed is the focal point of the room and also determines the placement of the rug. A rug not only helps to define the space but also provides a warm and comfortable place for your feet to rest each morning.</p>

<p>You should also consider the other features of the room, such as side tables, nightstands, benches, vanities, and vanities. Furniture that is attached to walls, such as dressers, does not need to be considered.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the rug so that it is completely under the bed</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>It is a good rule of thumb to leave 18-24 inches between the rug and any walkways.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place the Rug so that 2/3 of It is covered by the Bed</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>The popular option keeps 18-24 inches at the sides and the foot of your bed. For queen-sized beds, a 8x10 room rug is recommended. A 9x12 rug is for king-size beds.</p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <h4>Place two small runners on each side of the bed:</h4>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>This flexible option can be used with any type of bed. This is a great choice if your bed faces a wall. When considering this design, it is important to think about scale. The runners should not extend beyond the bed and should be slightly wider than the nightstand to achieve the desired look.</p>
